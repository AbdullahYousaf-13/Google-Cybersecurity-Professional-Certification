# Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

## Description
**Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL**, the fourth course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

By the end of this course, you will develop a greater understanding of the basics of computing that will support your work as a security analyst. You will learn foundational concepts related to understanding operating systems, communicating with the Linux operating system through commands, and querying databases with Structured Query Language (SQL). These are key concepts in the cybersecurity field and understanding them will help you keep organizations secure.

## Module 1: Introduction to operating systems
You will learn about the relationship between operating systems, hardware, and software, and become familiar with the primary functions of an operating system. You'll recognize common operating systems in use today and understand how the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) both allow users to interact with the operating system.

## Module 1
### Operating Systems
It's the interface between the computer hardware and the user. The operating system, or the OS as it's commonly called, is responsible for making the computer run as efficiently as possible while also making it easy to use. 

#### Major OS Categories
##### 1. Desktop OS
   - Windows (closed-source)  
   - macOS (partially open-source)  
   - Linux distributions (open-source)  

##### 2. Mobile OS
   - Android (open-source)  
   - iOS (partially open-source)  

##### 3. Cloud/Web-based OS
   - ChromeOS (partially open-source) 

#### Security Risks by Type
##### Desktop Systems
- Frequent target for malware
- Requires regular patching
- Enterprise deployments need centralized management

##### Mobile Systems
- App store vulnerabilities
- Device fragmentation issues
- Physical security concerns

##### Legacy Systems
- No security updates available
- Vulnerable to modern exploits
- Often found in industrial/medical equipment

#### Vulnerability Resources
Even when operating systems are kept up to date, they can still become vulnerable to attack. Below are several resources that include information on operating systems and their vulnerabilities.
- [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://msrc.microsoft.com)
- [Apple Security Updates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222)
- [CVE Report for Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/security/cve)
- [Google Cloud Security Bulletin](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins)

#### Key Takeaways
- Windows/macOS dominate enterprise environments  
- Linux critical for security tools  
- Mobile OS require special security considerations  
- Legacy systems create significant risk  
- Regular updates are essential for security
