## Module 1

### Network Devices
Network devices maintain information and services for users of a network. These devices connect over wired and wireless connections, sending data packets that contain information about the source and destination of the data.

### Key Concepts
- **Network**: The overall infrastructure enabling device communication
- **Network Devices**: Specialized equipment (routers, switches) that manage network traffic
- **End-user Devices**: Computers, phones, etc. that connect via network devices

### Common Network Components

#### 1. End-user Devices
- Personal computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets
- **Each has**:
  - Unique MAC address
  - IP address
  - Network interface for sending/receiving data
- **Connection methods**:
  - wired
  - wireless

#### 2. Firewalls
- Network security devices that monitor traffic
- First line of defense
- Can restrict specific incoming/outgoing traffic
- Typically positioned between internal networks and external/untrusted networks

#### 3. Servers
- Provide information and services to client devices
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - Clients send requests
  - Servers perform requests
- **Examples**:
  - DNS servers
  - File servers
  - Mail servers

#### 4. Hubs and Switches
##### Hubs
- Basic connection points for network devices
- Broadcast data to all ports (security vulnerability)
- Primarily used in limited setups (e.g., home offices)

##### Switches
- Intelligent traffic directors
- Forward packets only to intended devices
- Maintain MAC address tables
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved performance
  - Enhanced security
- Operate at Data Link Layer (TCP/IP model)

#### 5. Routers
- Connect different networks
- Direct traffic based on IP addresses
- **Features**:
  - Read IP headers
  - Forward packets toward destination
  - Often include firewall capabilities
- Operate at Network Layer (TCP/IP model)

#### 6. Modems and Wireless Access Points
##### Modems
- Connect to ISP
- Convert signals between ISP and local network
- Typically connect to routers
